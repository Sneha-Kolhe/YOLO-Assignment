    "\n",
    "YOLO processes the entire image in a single pass through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of sliding a fixed-size window over the image and making predictions at each location (as in traditional methods), YOLO divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the grid cells.\n",

    "Training Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO uses a multi-part loss function that combines localization loss (measuring the accuracy of bounding box predictions) and confidence loss (measuring the accuracy of objectness predictions) with a classification loss (measuring the accuracy of class predictions). The loss function is optimized end-to-end to jointly improve localization accuracy, objectness prediction, and class prediction.\n",

    "After prediction, YOLO applies non-maximum suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant bounding box predictions with high overlap. NMS selects the most confident bounding box among those with significant overlap and removes others, ensuring that each object is detected only once."
